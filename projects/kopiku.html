                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        After making several tiny projects with React, Kopiku was my first major React application.
                        It was inspired by a design I saw on <a href="https://dribble.com">dribble</a> and I thought
                        to myself, can I make something like that? Well after several days of mockups and coding, I
                        was able to come with Kopiku.

                <section class="right">
                    <h1>What is Kopiku</h1>
                    <p>
                        Kopiku is web app for buying coffee beans. it features a landing page and a product page.
                        It was made with React, React Router and SCSS. What motivated me to make this application was the
                        landing page. On desktop, it featured an elaborate animation on the top right component.
                        CSS animations was something I was still practicing at the time, making this was a way of taking it
                        to the next level.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Making this app, I learnt the benefits of planning a project before the actual coding process.
                        React offered me the opportunity to reuse components like shopping items, buttons etc. It also gave
                        me the chance to break big components into unit components (the phone at the top right of the app
                        is made up of over 12 different components). Managing states and other side effects
                        became a lot easier especially in managing reactive components.

                <p>
                    The making of this application thought me many valuable lessons, and there were some mistake and dead ends
                    that I encountered (like how the NextJS version kept running of memory), but in general, I took the experience
                    to my next project.
